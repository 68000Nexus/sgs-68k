Tools used in building the sgs
------------------------------

Built with above library, include, and source files and 
using the following SGSs:

	castra:/sgs/4.24   	SGS  for the cross  5on4  binaries  
	castra:/sgs/V3_2.1+   	SGS  for the native 5on5  binaries  
	castra:/sgs/s90p8a   	SGS  for the cross  5on90 binaries  

The other tools used were:
	ar, make, yacc, lex: V.3 release 2.0		(castra:/bin)

Build directory was castra:/mnt/barryk/sgs/aug11/a1000

Overlays:
	Recompiled "ld"; it was setting file header flag to F_POSIX.
	Recompiled "cc"; 1) conflict between -YS and -p flags
			 2) silently turned off coptim if file not found
