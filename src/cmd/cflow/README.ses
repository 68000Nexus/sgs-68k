	DESCRIPTION: cflow does not work, it says 
	"sh : /0lib : cannot excecute".  

	FIX/DISCUSSION: There was a c-style comment from the port, and
	the makefile didn't include a '-DFLEXNAMES' to make lpfx
	compatible with lint1, whose output it uses.

	FILES: 	/usr/src/cmd/cflow/cflow.mk
		/usr/src/cmd/cflow/cflow.sh
