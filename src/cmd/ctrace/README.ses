	DESCRIPTION:
ctrace cannot properly display negative integer values if the size of an
integer is the same as an character address pointer.  If they are the same,
the function, u_ct_, is fooled into thinking a character pointer value has
been passed to it.  The test that fails is on line 304 of the runtime.c
file and is:
if (_size == sizeof(char *) && value.p != 0) {
because value.p is 0xffff (for integer of -1_, this test is true and
allows the test on line 311 to be made:
if (*value.p!='\0')
which causes a 'Bus error - core dumped' to occur and aborts normal program
execution.

	FIX/DISCUSSION:
	if (_size == sizeof(char*) && value.i > 0) { 
	fixes the problem!!! maybe a little kludgy, since I don't know
	if we should be receiving a 0xffff value in value.[pild] or not
