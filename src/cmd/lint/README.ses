att call # 229683

	DESCRIPTION:
	The program with a line that starts with a "#line" and
	containing a quoted string will not work correctly.
	The following program will illustrate the program.

	#line 23 "xyxxy"
	main()
	{
	}

	FIX/DISCUSSION:
	The problem is due to the function werror() is called in
	"lint.c" with less arguments than it has. 
	Now the line "WERROR(WARNING(127));" in lint.c is changed to 
	"WERROR(WARNING(127), "", "");".

        

	FILES:
	usr/src/cmd/lint/lint.c

	RELEASE NOTE: (Document one or more of the following.)
