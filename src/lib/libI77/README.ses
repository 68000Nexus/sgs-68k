	DESCRIPTION:
	f77 could not read unformatted data of form
	2*,
	which was supposed to skip one complex input and one 
	double precision input.
	FIX:
	l_C: the routine that reads complex type input would swallow (GETC)
	the "2", and so not recognize the * syntax.
	an ungetc was added so that it could reread the digit.
