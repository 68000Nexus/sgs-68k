	DESCRIPTION:
		. I separated the makefiles as we did the 5.2.  
		  The libcrypt.mk makes the international crypt.
		  The dlibcrypt.mk makes the domestic crypt.
		. The des_(en)/(de)crypt.c files were too long for sccs, so i
		  shortened them (des is now d).
		. The des_decrypt.c file is actually a null file for the
		  international case.
	FIX:

	DESCRIPTION:
		In popen.c the array popen_pid is hardcoded 20 so that
		it can open at most 20 pipes.  But we want to support 64
		open files.
	FIX:
		Change the the number 20 in popen.c to be _NFILE.
	TECHNOTE:
