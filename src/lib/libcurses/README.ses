	DESCRIPTION:
		Some disturbing or interesting items.
		. it appears that SYSV is defined, but napms.c has some sort
		  of note saying use it at your own risk -- check out
		. setupterm.c has a define DUMPTI, but not defined (and we don't
		  have dumpti.c that the makefile references.)
		. vsprintf uses _NFILE !!!
		. curses.h term.h unctrl.h are installed to usr/include from 
		  here, not usr/src/uts/head (put a note in that directory that
		  this is the case)
		. the makefile makes a native tic to put into tmp where the
		  terminfo stuff can find it and use it.
		. new utilities: captoinfo, infocmp,show,dumpti(?)
		. use our termcap not theirs
		. dumpti is made but not installed, what is it?
		  ( install scripts don't show it as being installed )

att Call #225422
	DESCRIPTION: There is a problem in the curses library, where memory is
	malloc'ed and assumed to be initialized.

	FIX/DISCUSSION:
	Rather than using malloc(3C), use calloc(3C) when the memory should
	be initialized.

	FILES:
	usr/src/lib/libcurses/screen/setupterm.c

	RELEASE NOTE: (Document one or more of the following.)
ENHANCEMENT:  
PROBLEM_FIX:  
	The memory that is malloc'ed when using curses is assumed to be
	initialized. Therefore, calls to malloc have been changed to calls
	to calloc.

	DESCRIPTION: add character for 8 bit support was not working properly.
