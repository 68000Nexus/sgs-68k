		. This could use a nice bcopy in place of memcpy.
		. References to RIGHT_TO_LEFT in rtoken.c refers to the syntax
		  of the domain??? what is this, and are we left-to-right?
		. looks like some places in .h files are configurable...???

	DESCRIPTION:
	 Install this library in $SROOT/usr/src for access by the other

	 I take this to mean -- no installation in $(ROOT) and no distribution
	 to customers
