	DESCRIPTION:
		The first versions of v.3 on the current hardware will support
		shared libraries, but we will not be providing any. With the
		introduction of the 800 (bridge) the maximum address space
		will increase so that locations of currently defined shared
		libraries would be stuck in the middle of the new address 
		space instead of at the top where we would like it to be.
	FIX:
		Anyway, for this release use a modified nsl.mk to make a
		regular library. The nsl.mk.shar file contains the original
		shared library make that will be used later.
