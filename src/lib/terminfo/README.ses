	DESCRIPTION:
		Port of new terminal descriptions.
		Use all of the new descriptions. 
		Add the capability of handling the wy50 132 column.
		Add the qume101 description.
		Add the tvi910 description.
		This must always be made with the 5.3 tic, in ../libcurses. 
		That makefile will make localtic and install it in /tmp.
		(the old 5.2 tic bus errors.)
	FIX:
	TECHNOTE:
		The TERM name for wyse 50 terminals with the 132 column option 
		are the normal wyse 50 names appended with a 'w'.  (eg: wy50w)
		The following TERM strings are no longer supported:
			4027-17ws 		4027ex		aa
			aaa-rv-unk		alto		bitgraph-ni
			bg-ni			bitgraph-nv	bg2.0-nv
			bg-nv			bg		bg2.0-rv
			bg-rv			bitgraph-rv	bg1.25-nv
			bg1.25-rv		blit-pb		ca
			infoton			obitgraph	obitgraph-nv
			obitgraph-rv		screwpoint	zeph

	DESCRIPTION: When ESC Y is typed too quickly it causes 
	clear-to-end-of-screen. 

	FIX/DISCUSSION: removed setting for key_eos (clear-to-end-of-screen key
	sequence) for wyse 50 terminal type so that in the event that 
	ESC Y is typed too quickly it will not be interpreted as 
	clear-to-end-of-screen.
